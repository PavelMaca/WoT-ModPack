HD Minimap 2nd generation Mod by locastan.

The keycode is the only value not customizeable just now! For some reason the game refuses to register other keys than those it already knows from standard key binding.
If you want to remove the centered big minimap functionality on CTRL, set keycode to 66 or other number. :P

The markerscale factor can be anything from 0.01 for dot like icons, to 10.0+ for icons as big as the map.

The fontsize is in points, 5 is standard. The font does scale with the minimap icon size, so big values for markerscale also enlarge the visible text. Compensate if necessary. :)

shownames just controls whether the tanknames are visible on minimap and bigmap or not. Just put true or false in there.
